# cu-arduino-time-monitor
A server that monitors lap time log produced by arduino sensor. Created for use during my time as a teaching assistant in a "line tracer robot making" practical class in Chiba University. Written in Python (server, Flask) and JS (client, React), with additional DB management using SQLite3 and memcached.
